So I was thinking on how to host resources so they're both easy to maintain by us and easy to use by the members of our server.

### Discord server #resources channel
+ the simplest
+ no need to exit the app
+ supports simple formatting (markdown)
  - inserting images sucks tho
+ good for lists
- can get very messy very quickly
- Discord search function is crap
  + can mitigate this issue by posting one message per resource category and adding meaningful descriptions
- only the poster can edit the message
  + there exist bots that allow multiple mods to manage bot's messages
* backup by exporting the messages 

### Google Docs
+ easy to create and maintain in group
  - however, you gotta manage the access (for both editors and viewers)
+ supports text formating
  + allows for image insertion
- very shitty on mobile
  - cumbersome
  - hard to navigate between multiple files
- as aesthetic as MS Word documents can get
* backup by making a local copy of the document 
- screw Google a bit

### [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
- slightly harder to set up
  - i have no idea how to manage group editing
  - there are limits to the free plan
+ lots of customization
  + advanced text formatting
  + can be very aesthetic
+ easy to organize multiple files
- proprietary solution:
  - backup possible but not transferable to other solutions
    - that might've changed since i last used it
  - it's entirely on notions servers
- a bit heavy
- not mobile responsible
+ comes with team management solutions (not sure how to restrict the view on them)

### Static webiste
- very DIY solution
  + still much easier than making your own Tumblr theme
  * markdown is enough to create content
+ can work as a wiki
+ mobile-friendly
  - if we make it that way
  + otherwise very lightweight compared to Google Docs and Notion 
- hosted by us but that can be done on Github for free 
+ you're just viewing one
